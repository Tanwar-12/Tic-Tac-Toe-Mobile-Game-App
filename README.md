# Tic Tac Toe Mobile Game  App

*Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbols (X or O), and the objective is to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent does. If the entire grid is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.*
